# Hi! I'm Relism, a Passionate Java Developer.

Over 4 years of experienceâ€”3 of which have been dedicated to Spigot and its forks. I am also experienced with Velocity for proxy-side development, integrating backend technologies like custom APIs using Node.js and WebSockets, among other technologies like Fabric! (check my Modrinth account for more info on that)
